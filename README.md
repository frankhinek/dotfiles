# dotfiles
> Personal collection of dotfiles for Mac OS X

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

## Approach

Initially I planned to include the installation of Homebrew, zsh, Atom, and
other applications along with configuration related dotfiles.  I took a queue
from Caarlos0's [machine](https://github.com/caarlos0/machine) project and
decided to copy the pattern of keeping [software installation](https://github.com/frankhinek/mac-setup) and
[configuration](https://github.com/frankhinek/dotfiles) in separate repositories.

## Compatibility

These scripts and dotfiles have only been tested on macOS X El Capitan.

## Roadmap

- [x] Create bootstrap script
- [ ] Configure git
- [ ] Configure atom
- [ ] Configure zsh

## Thanks

Rather than forking an existing dotfile repository I started from a blank canvas
and added only what I needed.  However, nearly every bit of this was copied
directly from or heavily based on work by the individuals listed below.
Thanks to all that shared their work!

## Additional References

There are sure to be thousands of different collections of dotfiles but here are
a few I came across.  I did not reuse any code from these, but they may be
valuable as a source of ideas for others.
