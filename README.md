# dotfiles
> Personal collection of dotfiles for Mac OS X

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

## Compatibility

These scripts and dotfiles have only been tested on Mac OS X El Capitan.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Install ZSH
- [ ] Install Docker for Mac

## Thanks

Rather than forking an existing dotfile repository I started from a blank canvas
and added only what I needed.  However, nearly every bit of this was copied
directly from or heavily based on work by the individuals listed below.
Thanks to all that shared their work!
